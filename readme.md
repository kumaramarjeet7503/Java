# Java Data Structures

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of common data structures implemented in Java. These data structures serve as fundamental building blocks for various algorithms and applications and are designed for efficiency, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Data Structures Included

1. **ArrayList:** A dynamic array implementation that automatically resizes itself as elements are added or removed.

2. **LinkedList:** A doubly linked list that supports efficient insertion and deletion operations.

3. **Stack:** A stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.

4. **Queue:** A queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations (both linear and circular queue variants included).

5. **HashMap:** A hash table-based implementation of a map (key-value pairs).

6. **BinarySearchTree:** An implementation of a binary search tree with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
